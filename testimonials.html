                I have been an NBA assistant coach for 25 years, for ten different teams, and have had the opportunity to work with many skill development coaches during this time.  
                I have observed the practices conducted by Anthony Maniscalco and put him on a par with some of the best I have seen.  Anthony knows the techniques necessary to make players better and his attention to detail is second to none.

                I’m honored to write this testimonial with regards to Anthony Maniscalco. 
                I can’t state enough how important Anthony has been to my success over the past 15 years. 
                I would say a characteristic of my Nazareth Teams is how fundamentally individually skilled our players are, and this is 100% due to Anthony’s time, experience, and expertise. 
                Anthony truly is one of a kind and he has had a major impact on Nazareth being a perennial state power. He is invaluable and a man I truly respect and appreciate.

                Anthony’s ability to teach the game, develop young players confidence and improve there skills is a testament to not only his basketball knowledge but his tremendous ability to connect with young players. 
                From my own personal experience with Anthony training some of my own family members and also observing him training some of the best young players in the Chicago area. 
                I highly recommend to anyone looking for a premier basketball trainer to engage the services of  Anthony Maniscalco.

                Anthony is one of the best teachers of skill that I have encountered in over 30 years of high school coaching. 
                His proven methods have helped numerous players improve and develop their games. 
                I would highly recommend him to players of all ages that are serious about getting better.
